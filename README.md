# Syncordian

Collaborative editing, as observed in projects such as Google Docs, often relies on costly
central services. While many CRDT exists to solve this problem, to date none have
mechanisms to support Byzantine faults and the presence of interleavings. We present the
Syncordian CRDT, which guarantees strong eventual consistency and intention preservation
between nodes as a consequence of the Byzantine faults-free algorithm implemented for
insertions, deletions, and update operations in share documents. Our scheme withstands
Byzantine nodes, providing immunity against Sybil attacks and ensuring strong eventual
consistency. Moreover, the presented algorithm naturally avoids interleavings when
synchronizing nodes. To evaluate Syncordian we use collaborative editing document taken
from github with over 700 concurrent edit operations contributed by 25 network peers. With
this evaluation we validate Syncordian is effective in maintaining document consistency
across all peers, even in the presence of Byzantine nodes. Moreover, we evaluate the
performance of the Syncordian with respect to memory consumption, network load, and
execution, demonstrating its usability in real world scenarios.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- Erlang:  [Erlang/OTP 27](https://www.erlang.org/downloads/27)
- Elixir: [Install Elixir v.17.0](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Masanar/Syncordian.git 
cd syncordian
mkdir -p debug/documents
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
mix phx.server
```

Once the server starts, you can visit your application at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Features

Syncordian is designed to be a peer-to-peer collaborative editing tool that uses CRDT to
ensure strong eventual consistency across nodes, even in the presence of Byzantine faults.

## Project Structure

- lib/: This folder contains the Elixir modules, including the CRDT logic.
- lib/syncordian/: This folder contains the backend implementation of the CRDT logic for
  Syncordian
- lib/syncordian_web/: This folder contains the Phoenix LiveView pages and components.

## LiveView Pages

[Syncordian web page](http://localhost:4000) includes several LiveView pages:

- /node: Displays the raw content (including tombstones) of the local document of any
  node.
- /supervisor: Interacts with the supervisor and its controlled processes. This page
allows to start the supervisor, run commits one by one, send all commits automatically or
write the current document (no tombstones) of all nodes as text files to the directory
/debug/documents. Once you write the document you may want to compere them against the
actual version of the document, the directory /debug/README_versions contains all the 71
documents versions for all the 71 commits.
- /readmelog: Provides the logs of the 71 commits for the text, just a visual tool to
check each the behavior of each commit.
- /about: An short about page with some information about the project.
