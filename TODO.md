# Pending or Important task

Check list to track the progress and current working on

## Woking on

I think tha the global_position also must be shifted with the advance of the commits
you are having more and more tombstones to take into account (?)


## Pending

    - [x] Send the confirmation message to the sender when inserte a new incoming
    message.
    - [ ] TODO: When calculating the distance between the clocks, need the case when the
    value is less than or equal to 0, this is probably due to an interiving solved case.
    - [ ] TODO: When adding a new line to the document change update the commit_at list?
    in the receving peer?

    - [ ] TODO: revie the distance, it is possible to be distance 0, we are comparing the
    receving projection howcome that we have a message from the recing peer that has 0
    as a distance that means that we have all the information from that peer.

## Ideas

    - Using the sucsefully inserted message we can update receiving peer clock??
