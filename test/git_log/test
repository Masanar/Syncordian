+
+## Getting Started
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+__Disclaimer:__ _Oh My Zsh works best on OS X and Linux._
+
+* Unix-based operating system (OS X or Linux)
+* [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org) should be installed (v4.3.9 or more recent). If not pre-installed (`zsh --version` to confirm), check the following instruction here: [Installing ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
+* `curl` or `wget` should be installed
+* `git` should be installed
+
+### Basic Installation
+
+Oh My Zsh is installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal. You can install this via the command-line with either `curl` or `wget`.
+
+#### via curl
+
+```shell
+sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
+```
+
+#### via wget
+
+```shell
+sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
+```
+
+## Using Oh My Zsh
+
+### Plugins
+
+Oh My Zsh comes with a shit load of plugins to take advantage of. You can take a look in the [plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins) directory and/or the [wiki](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins) to see what's currently available.
+
+#### Enabling Plugins
+
+If you spot a plugin (or several) that you would like to use with Oh My Zsh, you will need to edit the `~/.zshrc` file. Once you open it with your favorite editor, you'll see a spot to list all the plugins that you'd like Oh My Zsh to load in initialization.
+
+For example, this line might begin to look like...
+
+```shell
+plugins=(git bundler osx rake ruby)
+```
+
+#### Using Plugins
+
+Most plugins (should! we're working on this) include a __README__, which documents how to use them.
+
+### Themes
+
+We'll admit it. Early in the Oh My Zsh world, we may have gotten a bit too theme happy. We have over one hundred themes now bundled. Most of them have [screenshots](https://wiki.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/themes) on the wiki. Check them out!
+
+#### Selecting a Theme
+
+_Robby's theme is the default one. It's not the fanciest one. It's not the simplest one. It's just right (for him)._
+
+Once you find a theme that you want to use, you will need to edit the `~/.zshrc` file. You'll see an environment variable (all caps) in there that looks like:
+
+```shell
+ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
+```
+
+To use a different theme, simply change the value to match the name of your desired theme. For example:
+
+```shell
+ZSH_THEME="agnoster" # (this is one of the fancy ones)
+```
+
+Open up a new terminal window and your prompt should look something like...
+
+![Agnoster theme](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2618447/6316862/70f58fb6-ba03-11e4-82c9-c083bf9a6574.png)
+
+In case you did not find a suitable theme for your needs, please have a look at the wiki for [more of them](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/External-themes).
+
+If you're feeling feisty, you can let the computer select one randomly for you each time you open a new terminal window.

+## Advanced Topics
+
+If you're the type that likes to get their hands dirty, these sections might resonate.
+
+### Advanced Installation
+
+Some users may want to change the default path, or manually install Oh My Zsh.
+
+#### Custom Directory
+
+The default location is `~/.oh-my-zsh` (hidden in your home directory)
+
+If you'd like to change the install directory with the `ZSH` environment variable, either by running `export ZSH=/your/path` before installing, or by setting it before the end of the install pipeline like this:
+
+```shell
+export ZSH="$HOME/.dotfiles/oh-my-zsh"; sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
+```
+
+#### Manual Installation
+
+##### 1. Clone the repository:
+
+```shell
+git clone git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh
+```
+
+##### 2. *Optionally*, backup your existing `~/.zshrc` file:
+
+```shell
+cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig
+```
+
+##### 3. Create a new zsh configuration file
+
+You can create a new zsh config file by copying the template that we included for you.
+
+```shell
+cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
+```
+
+##### 4. Change your default shell
+
+```shell
+chsh -s /bin/zsh
+```
+
+##### 5. Initialize your new zsh configuration
+
+Once you open up a new terminal window, it should load zsh with Oh My Zsh's configuration.
+
+### Installation Problems
+
+If you have any hiccups installing, here are a few common fixes.
+
+* You _might_ need to modify your `PATH` in `~/.zshrc` if you're not able to find some commands after switching to `oh-my-zsh`.
+* If you installed manually or changed the install location, check the `ZSH` environment variable in `~/.zshrc`.
+
+### Custom Plugins and Themes
+
+If you want to override any of the default behaviors, just add a new file (ending in `.zsh`) in the `custom/` directory.
+
+If you have many functions that go well together, you can put them as a `XYZ.plugin.zsh` file in the `custom/plugins/` directory and then enable this plugin.
+
+If you would like to override the functionality of a plugin distributed with Oh My Zsh, create a plugin of the same name in the `custom/plugins/` directory and it will be loaded instead of the one in `plugins/`.
+
+## Getting Updates
+
+By default, you will be prompted to check for upgrades every few weeks. If you would like `oh-my-zsh` to automatically upgrade itself without prompting you, set the following in your `~/.zshrc`:
+
+```shell
+DISABLE_UPDATE_PROMPT=true
+```
+
+To disable automatic upgrades, set the following in your `~/.zshrc`:
+
+```shell
+DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=true
+```
+
+### Manual Updates
+
+If you'd like to upgrade at any point in time (maybe someone just released a new plugin and you don't want to wait a week?) you just need to run:
+
+```shell
+upgrade_oh_my_zsh
+```
+
+Magic!
+
+## Uninstalling Oh My Zsh
+
+Oh My Zsh isn't for everyone. We'll miss you, but we want to make this an easy breakup.
+
+If you want to uninstall `oh-my-zsh`, just run `uninstall_oh_my_zsh` from the command-line. It will remove itself and revert your previous `bash` or `zsh` configuration.
+
+## Contributing
+
+I'm far from being a [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) expert and suspect there are many ways to improve – if you have ideas on how to make the configuration easier to maintain (and faster), don't hesitate to fork and send pull requests!
+
+We also need people to test out pull-requests. So take a look through [the open issues](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues) and help where you can.
+
+### Do NOT send us themes
+
+We have (more than) enough themes for the time being. Please add your theme to the [external themes](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/External-themes) wiki page.
