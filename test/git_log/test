+`gls` command) when enabling colorized `ls` in `lib/theme-and-appearance.zsh`. If you want to disable this
+behaviour you can use zstyle-based config before sourcing `oh-my-zsh.sh`:
+
+```zsh
+zstyle ':omz:lib:theme-and-appearance' gnu-ls no
+```

commit 1ad167dfac325a9f92e0693c70d0ab3f7c4c574b
Author: Marc Cornell√† <hello@mcornella.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 3 23:14:36 2023 +0200

    feat(init)!: allow turning off aliases for libs and plugins (#11550)
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: the previous zstyle setting to disable `lib/directories.zsh` aliases has
    been changed to the new syntax: `zstyle ':omz:lib:directories' aliases no`. See
    https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh#skip-aliases to see other ways you can use this setting.

+If you want to skip default Oh My Zsh aliases (those defined in `lib/*` files) or plugin aliases,
+you can use the settings below in your `~/.zshrc` file, **before Oh My Zsh is loaded**. Note that
+there are many different ways to skip aliases, depending on your needs.
+
+```sh
+# Skip all aliases, in lib files and enabled plugins
+zstyle ':omz:*' aliases no
+
+# Skip all aliases in lib files
+zstyle ':omz:lib:*' aliases no
+# Skip only aliases defined in the directories.zsh lib file
+zstyle ':omz:lib:directories' aliases no
+
+# Skip all plugin aliases
+zstyle ':omz:plugins:*' aliases no
+# Skip only the aliases from the git plugin
+zstyle ':omz:plugins:git' aliases no
+```
+
+You can combine these in other ways taking into account that more specific scopes takes precedence:
+
+```sh
+# Skip all plugin aliases, except for the git plugin
+zstyle ':omz:plugins:*' aliases no
+zstyle ':omz:plugins:git' aliases yes
+```
+
+A previous version of this feature was using the setting below, which has been removed:
+
+```sh
 zstyle ':omz:directories' aliases no
 ```
 
+Instead, you can now use the following:
+
+```sh
+zstyle ':omz:lib:directories' aliases no
+```
+
+#### Notice <!-- omit in toc -->
+
+> This feature is currently in a testing phase and it may be subject to change in the future.
+> It is also not currently compatible with plugin managers such as zpm or zinit, which don't
+> source the init script (`oh-my-zsh.sh`) where this feature is implemented in.
+
+> It is also not currently aware of "aliases" that are defined as functions. Example of such
+> are `gccd`, `ggf`, or `ggl` functions from the git plugin.
+
 ## Getting Updates
 
 By default, you will be prompted to check for updates every 2 weeks. You can choose other update modes by adding a line to your `~/.zshrc` file, **before Oh My Zsh is loaded**:

    readme: document oneliner unattended installation command (#7983)
    
    The original suggestion for an unattended install downloads the installation script to a file, then runs that file with the --unattended argument. The install.sh file would be left behind after the suggested command was run.
    This change passes the --unattended argument directly into sh. So, it's a nice one-liner like the default installation script, and it doesn't leave a dangling install.sh script.

+ZSH="$HOME/.dotfiles/oh-my-zsh" sh install.sh
+```
+
+#### Unattended install
+
+If you're running the Oh My Zsh install script as part of an automated install, you can pass the
+flag `--unattended` to the `install.sh` script. This will have the effect of not trying to change
+the default shell, and also won't run `zsh` when the installation has finished.
 
 ```shell
-export ZSH="$HOME/.dotfiles/oh-my-zsh"; sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
+curl -Lo install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh
+sh install.sh --unattended
+```
+
+#### Installing from a forked repository
+
+The install script also accepts these variables to allow installation of a different repository:
+
+- `REPO` (default: `robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh`): this takes the form of `owner/repository`. If you set
+  this variable, the installer will look for a repository at `https://github.com/{owner}/{repository}`.
+
+- `REMOTE` (default: `https://github.com/${REPO}.git`): this is the full URL of the git repository
+  clone. You can use this setting if you want to install from a fork that is not on GitHub (GitLab,
+  Bitbucket...) or if you want to clone with SSH instead of HTTPS (`git@github.com:user/project.git`).
+
+  _NOTE: it's incompatible with setting the `REPO` variable. This setting will take precedence._
+
+- `BRANCH` (default: `master`): you can use this setting if you want to change the default branch to be
+  checked out when cloning the repository. This might be useful for testing a Pull Request, or if you
+  want to use a branch other than `master`.
+
+For example:
+
+```shell
+REPO=apjanke/oh-my-zsh BRANCH=edge sh install.sh

+
+## Getting Started
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+__Disclaimer:__ _Oh My Zsh works best on OS X and Linux._
+
+* Unix-based operating system (OS X or Linux)
+* [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org) should be installed (v4.3.9 or more recent). If not pre-installed (`zsh --version` to confirm), check the following instruction here: [Installing ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
+* `curl` or `wget` should be installed
+* `git` should be installed
+
+### Basic Installation
+
+Oh My Zsh is installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal. You can install this via the command-line with either `curl` or `wget`.
+
+#### via curl
+
+```shell
+sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
+```
+
+#### via wget
+
+```shell
+sh -c "$(wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O -)"
+```
+
+## Using Oh My Zsh
+
+### Plugins
+
+Oh My Zsh comes with a shit load of plugins to take advantage of. You can take a look in the [plugins](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins) directory and/or the [wiki](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins) to see what's currently available.
+
+#### Enabling Plugins
+
+If you spot a plugin (or several) that you would like to use with Oh My Zsh, you will need to edit the `~/.zshrc` file. Once you open it with your favorite editor, you'll see a spot to list all the plugins that you'd like Oh My Zsh to load in initialization.
+
+For example, this line might begin to look like...
+
+```shell
+plugins=(git bundler osx rake ruby)
+```
+
+#### Using Plugins
+
+Most plugins (should! we're working on this) include a __README__, which documents how to use them.
+
+### Themes
+
+We'll admit it. Early in the Oh My Zsh world, we may have gotten a bit too theme happy. We have over one hundred themes now bundled. Most of them have [screenshots](https://wiki.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/themes) on the wiki. Check them out!
+
+#### Selecting a Theme
+
+_Robby's theme is the default one. It's not the fanciest one. It's not the simplest one. It's just right (for him)._
+
+Once you find a theme that you want to use, you will need to edit the `~/.zshrc` file. You'll see an environment variable (all caps) in there that looks like:
+
+```shell
+ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"
+```
+
+To use a different theme, simply change the value to match the name of your desired theme. For example:
+
+```shell
+ZSH_THEME="agnoster" # (this is one of the fancy ones)
+```
+
+Open up a new terminal window and your prompt should look something like...
+
+![Agnoster theme](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2618447/6316862/70f58fb6-ba03-11e4-82c9-c083bf9a6574.png)
+
+In case you did not find a suitable theme for your needs, please have a look at the wiki for [more of them](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/External-themes).
+
+If you're feeling feisty, you can let the computer select one randomly for you each time you open a new terminal window.
+
+
+```shell
+ZSH_THEME="random" # (...please let it be pie... please be some pie..)
+```
+
+
+## Advanced Topics
+
+If you're the type that likes to get their hands dirty, these sections might resonate.
+
+### Advanced Installation
+
+Some users may want to change the default path, or manually install Oh My Zsh.
+
+#### Custom Directory
+
+The default location is `~/.oh-my-zsh` (hidden in your home directory)
+
+If you'd like to change the install directory with the `ZSH` environment variable, either by running `export ZSH=/your/path` before installing, or by setting it before the end of the install pipeline like this:
+
+```shell
+export ZSH="$HOME/.dotfiles/oh-my-zsh"; sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
+```
+
+#### Manual Installation
+
+##### 1. Clone the repository:
+
+```shell
+git clone git://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.git ~/.oh-my-zsh
+```
+
+##### 2. *Optionally*, backup your existing `~/.zshrc` file:
+
+```shell
+cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig
+```
+
+##### 3. Create a new zsh configuration file
+
+You can create a new zsh config file by copying the template that we included for you.
+
+```shell
+cp ~/.oh-my-zsh/templates/zshrc.zsh-template ~/.zshrc
+```
+
+##### 4. Change your default shell
+
+```shell
+chsh -s /bin/zsh
+```
+
+##### 5. Initialize your new zsh configuration
+
+Once you open up a new terminal window, it should load zsh with Oh My Zsh's configuration.
+
+### Installation Problems
+
+If you have any hiccups installing, here are a few common fixes.
+
+* You _might_ need to modify your `PATH` in `~/.zshrc` if you're not able to find some commands after switching to `oh-my-zsh`.
+* If you installed manually or changed the install location, check the `ZSH` environment variable in `~/.zshrc`.
+
+### Custom Plugins and Themes
+
+If you want to override any of the default behaviors, just add a new file (ending in `.zsh`) in the `custom/` directory.
+
+If you have many functions that go well together, you can put them as a `XYZ.plugin.zsh` file in the `custom/plugins/` directory and then enable this plugin.
+
+If you would like to override the functionality of a plugin distributed with Oh My Zsh, create a plugin of the same name in the `custom/plugins/` directory and it will be loaded instead of the one in `plugins/`.
+
+## Getting Updates
+
+By default, you will be prompted to check for upgrades every few weeks. If you would like `oh-my-zsh` to automatically upgrade itself without prompting you, set the following in your `~/.zshrc`:
+
+```shell
+DISABLE_UPDATE_PROMPT=true
+```
+
+To disable automatic upgrades, set the following in your `~/.zshrc`:
+
+```shell
+DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=true
+```
+
+### Manual Updates
+
+If you'd like to upgrade at any point in time (maybe someone just released a new plugin and you don't want to wait a week?) you just need to run:
+
+```shell
+upgrade_oh_my_zsh
+```
+
+Magic!
+
+## Uninstalling Oh My Zsh
+
+Oh My Zsh isn't for everyone. We'll miss you, but we want to make this an easy breakup.
+
+If you want to uninstall `oh-my-zsh`, just run `uninstall_oh_my_zsh` from the command-line. It will remove itself and revert your previous `bash` or `zsh` configuration.
+
+## Contributing
+
+I'm far from being a [Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) expert and suspect there are many ways to improve ‚Äì if you have ideas on how to make the configuration easier to maintain (and faster), don't hesitate to fork and send pull requests!
+
+We also need people to test out pull-requests. So take a look through [the open issues](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/issues) and help where you can.
+
+### Do NOT send us themes
+
+We have (more than) enough themes for the time being. Please add your theme to the [external themes](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/External-themes) wiki page.
+

+Oh My Zsh has a vibrant community of happy users and delightful contributors. Without all the time and help from our contributors, it wouldn't be so awesome.
